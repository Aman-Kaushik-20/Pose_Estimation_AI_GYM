# Pose Power Gym

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/885ec838-4478-4073-85a3-f318cc015dee


An AI-powered application that helps users maintain proper form during common strength training exercises by analyzing exercise videos using pose estimation.

## Problem Statement

Many gym-goers struggle with maintaining proper form during exercises, which can lead to:
- Reduced exercise effectiveness
- Increased risk of injury
- Slower progress in strength gains
- Difficulty in tracking improvement

## Features

- Video upload and analysis for three key exercises:
  - Push-ups
  - Deadlifts
  - Bicep Curls
- Real-time form feedback and rep counting
- Progress tracking visualization
- Detailed exercise instructions
- Exercise demonstration videos
- Form analysis reports with angles and metrics

## Technical Approach

### Pose Estimation
- Utilizes MediaPipe Pose for skeletal tracking
- Tracks key anatomical landmarks:
  - Push-ups: shoulder, elbow, wrist angles
  - Deadlifts: shoulder, hip, knee, ankle positions
  - Bicep Curls: shoulder, elbow, wrist positioning

### Exercise Analysis
- **Push-ups**:
  - Tracks arm angle (160° to 30°)
  - Monitors proper descent and ascent
  - Counts full repetitions

- **Deadlifts**:
  - Measures hip angle (150° to 180°)
  - Analyzes back positioning
  - Monitors knee alignment

- **Bicep Curls**:
  - Tracks elbow flexion (140° to 40°)
  - Ensures proper arm positioning
  - Validates full range of motion

### User Interface
- Built with Streamlit
- Cyberpunk-inspired design
- Responsive layout
- Exercise-specific instruction panels
- Progress visualization

## Required Libraries

import mediapipe as mp
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import tempfile
from datetime import datetime
```

### Core Components

#### Angle Calculation
```python
def calculate_angle(a, b, c):
    """Calculate angle between three points"""
    a = np.array(a)
    b = np.array(b)
    c = np.array(c)
    radians = np.arctan2(c[1]-b[1], c[0]-b[0]) - np.arctan2(a[1]-b[1], a[0]-b[0])
    angle = np.abs(radians*180.0/np.pi)
    if angle > 180.0:
        angle = 360-angle
    return angle
```

#### Exercise Processing Examples

1. Bicep Curl Detection:
```python
# Get coordinates
shoulder = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_SHOULDER.value]
elbow = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_ELBOW.value]
wrist = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_WRIST.value]

# Calculate curl angle
angle = calculate_angle(shoulder, elbow, wrist)

# Rep counting logic
if angle > 140:
    stage = "down"
if angle < 40 and stage == 'down':
    stage = "up"
    counter += 1
```

2. Deadlift Detection:
```python
# Get coordinates
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
shoulder = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_SHOULDER.value]
hips = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_HIP.value]
knee = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_KNEE.value]
ankle = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_ANKLE.value]

# Calculate angles
hip_angle = calculate_angle(shoulder, hips, knee)
knee_angle = calculate_angle(hips, knee, ankle)

# Stage detection
if hip_angle < 110 and stage != "Down":
    stage = "Down"
elif 110 <= hip_angle < 160 and (stage == "Down" or stage == "Lockout"):
    stage = "Up"
elif 160 <= hip_angle <= 180 and stage == "Up":
    stage = "Lockout"
    counter += 1
```

3. Push-up Detection:
```python
# Get coordinates
shoulder = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_SHOULDER.value]
elbow = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_ELBOW.value]
wrist = landmarks[mp_pose.PoseLandmark.LEFT_WRIST.value]

angle = calculate_angle(shoulder, elbow, wrist)

# Rep counting
if angle > 160:
    stage = "down"
if angle < 30 and stage == 'down':
    stage = "up"
    counter += 1
```
